Crop-Recommendation-System-Soil-Analysis
India is the homeland to a variety of crops and the second populous country. The major percentage of the population are dependent on Agriculture for a living.The growing need of demand for food urges the young ML engineers like us to develop sophisticated systems for a more efficient farming and make it more profitable too. This project has a wide vision of implementing this crop recommendation system to the country's benefit.

Dataset is taken from Kaggle. Link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srinivas1/agricuture-crops-production-in-india

Algorithm :

Accuracy of the model using Linear Regression is 95%.

Accuracy of the model using Decision Tree Regressor is 96%.

Accuracy of the model using Random Forest Regressor is 97%.

Accuracy of the model using Support Vector Regression is 96%.

Out of the four Algorithms, Random Forest Regressor has better Performance. After Cross Validation of Random Forest Regressor the Accuracy is 99% and it is used for development of model.

Deployment :

We have used flask to create the application.
